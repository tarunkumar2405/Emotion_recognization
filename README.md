Emotion Recognition from IP Camera Feed

This project demonstrates real-time facial emotion recognition using an IP camera feed. The facial_emotion_recognition library is utilized to analyze frames and identify emotions, displaying the results directly on the video feed.

Features

Real-time emotion recognition.

Integration with IP camera feed.

Display of detected emotions on the video feed.

Lightweight implementation using the facial_emotion_recognition library.

Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.6 or higher.

Required Python libraries:

facial_emotion_recognition

opencv-python

numpy

imutils

An IP camera with a valid stream URL.

Installation

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/emotion-recognition-ip-camera.git
cd emotion-recognition-ip-camera

Install the required libraries:

pip install facial_emotion_recognition opencv-python numpy imutils

Usage

Set up your IP camera and note its stream URL. For instance, if youâ€™re using an IP webcam app on your phone, the URL might look like:

http://192.168.1.34:8080/shot.jpg

Update the url variable in the script with your camera's URL:

url = 'http://192.168.1.34:8080/shot.jpg'

Run the script:

python emotion_recognition.py

Press Esc to exit the application.

Code Overview

Dependencies

facial_emotion_recognition: For detecting facial emotions.

opencv-python: For video processing and frame handling.

numpy: For numerical operations.

imutils: For easier frame manipulation.

urllib.request: For accessing the IP camera stream.

Main Script

Initialize Emotion Recognition:

er = EmotionRecognition(device='cpu')

Access IP Camera Feed:

imgPath = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
imgNp = np.array(bytearray(imgPath.read()), dtype=np.uint8)
frame = cv2.imdecode(imgNp, -1)

Process and Display Emotion:

frame = er.recognise_emotion(frame, return_type='BGR')
cv2.putText(frame, "Emotion: ", (10, 40), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1.5, (0, 255, 0), 3)
cv2.imshow("Frame", frame)

Clean Up:

cam.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

Customization

Emotion Label Placement: Adjust the coordinates in cv2.putText to change where the emotion label appears.

Camera Feed Resolution: Resize the frame for consistent dimensions using OpenCV functions, such as cv2.resize.

Device Selection: Use GPU for better performance by setting device='cuda' in EmotionRecognition.

Troubleshooting

Camera Connection Issues: Ensure the IP camera is on the same network and its URL is accessible.

Dependency Errors: Verify that all required libraries are installed and compatible with your Python version.

Emotion Recognition Accuracy: Ensure proper lighting and clear visibility of faces in the camera feed.

Future Enhancements

Support for multiple faces in a single frame.

Integration with cloud storage to save detected emotions for further analysis.

Enhanced visualization with graphical overlays.
